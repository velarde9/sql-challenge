# sql-challenge

A research project was conducted to examine people that a company employed during the 1980s and 1990s. 

Data modelling was conducted by using QuickDBD to create an image of the ER diagram as a reference, data engineering was performed during the construction of the table schemata, and a data analysis was performed based on specific requests.  

In this repository, the EmployeeSQL folder contains the following files:
- an image of the ER diagram that was created using QuickDBD
- an sql file of the table schemata
- an sql file of the queries

The Resources folder contains the csv files from the employee database that were imported into the tables that were created.

The queries that were created answered the following requests:
- List the employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee.
- List the first name, last name, and hire date for the employees who were hired in 1986.
- List the manager of each department along with their department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name.
- List the department number for each employee along with that employeeâ€™s employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
- List first name, last name, and sex of each employee whose first name is Hercules and whose last name begins with the letter B.
- List each employee in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, and first name.
- List each employee in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
- List the frequency counts, in descending order, of all the employee last names (that is, how many employees share each last name).
